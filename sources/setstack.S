| _setstack: changes the stack pointer; called as
|     void setstack( void *newsp )
| called from crtinit.c once the new stack size has been decided upon
|
| Note: It is strictly forbidden to read or write data at *newsp or beyond.
| Unfortunately, there are known bugs in the trap #1 handlers of most
| operating systems. For example, older versions of the MiNT kernel
| reads unconditionally 36 bytes from the user stack on any trap #1, even
| if there are no parameters at all. So if *newsp is actually unreadable
| (end of RAM, MMU protected...), the program will crash on the first
| trap #1 call.
| As a workaround, we can waste some space at the top of the new stack
| to ensure it will be readable by the buggy OS. 64 bytes should be enough.
|
| WARNING WARNING WARNING: after you do this, local variables may no longer
| be accessible!
