TEST PROGRAM FOR printf() FORMATTING

  The program creates a (large) file of formatting results. Line endings
  are always CRLF.

CURRENT STATE:

  Only integer format strings will be testet:
  d, i, u, o, x, X

USAGE:

  Compile one version with libcmini and run it in an emulator.

  Compile another version in an environment which will give correct
  results. E.g. Linux:
  
  $ gcc printf_formatting.c -o printf_formatting

  You will find the results in a file test.txt in the respective working
  directory.

  Both files should be identical.
